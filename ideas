Care Package

I joined the NV Army National Guard in 2007, in 2011 my unit deployed to
Afghanistan. It was a challenging year away from family and the niceties of
home.  One of the things that kept me going was recieving care packages. I
recieved these from friends and family often and had great support
from home.  In the packages Anthony sent he always included books about
investing and finance.

One of the first books I recieved: [The Vital Few vs. the Trivial
Many](http://www.amazon.com/The-Vital-Few-Trivial-Many/dp/0471681954). Inside
were some basic insights into insider trading strategies. The book was
primarily entertaining stories from the authors life. This gentle introduction
to the insider strategies was just what I needed to start researching
insider filings and learning to analyze trades.

In the book,  Muzea says that after being in the stock market losers camp and
recognizing there were some traders who were doing much better than he, that he 
would devote his life to finding ways to find the smarter investors. After
finding his way of monitoring what he called the Vital Few, he became a
consistent stock market winner.

I really enjoyed the anectdotes and felt I really related with the author.

The major takeaways from his information on insider trading:

+  Big mistakes: 
   - investing without a plan or strategy (Georges is top down and
     will buy both growth and value stocks as long as they accompany insider
     buying)
   - following experts especially in the media
   - investing at the wrong time

+  Be contrarian and find times where the public is selling and insiders are 
buying, stay out until then (maybe years).

+  Look for divergences in insider behavior

+  There are two groups of insiders, one group consisting of about 70% of
insiders trade on value, they buy when the book value is down and sell into
strength. The other group buys into strength and might be a better indicator of
momentum.

+  The officer title is important. CFO is likely money smarter than a director
of some one off product.




Night Traders

While deployed my passion for investing not only grew but spread to other men
in my unit. While working we would talk about new companies we were looking at
and sharing things we learned from basic personal finance books.

The timezone difference between Kandahar, Afghanistan and New York is 8.5
hours.  This means that most of our trading happened at night. Because of this
we named our small group of investors: Night Traders.

After reading The Vital Few vs. the Trivial Many I first started including
insider trading into my basic research, and eventually used insider as the lead
generation tool, finding companies i should consider looking more into.

I would sit for hours reading through the [most recent SEC
filings](http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcurrent) and
constantly refresh my browser to see the latest. Addictive at first, but then
frustrating. New trades would show, but not always ones I thought were
interesting. This active analysis was pretty good and I was able to make some
really great trades from filings I read. The drawback: time commitment. I
had to sit and watch as filings came in.


No more refresh!

Sick of refreshing!!! At somepoint during deployment I started to use my short 
sprints of horrendously slow civilian satelite connections to develop
a super rough draft of what would eventually become Insider AI.

I found some a web based IDE (that probably no longer exists) that would run C# 
in a sand box. With this I wrote a RSS Feed reader that would visit the recent
filings every 15 seconds and using some basic rules would popup a raw javascript
alert box letting me know that I should check the page.

I told you it was a rough draft :)


CS 457 Database Management Systems

Just after deployment in 2012 during my last semester of undergrad I 
took a class about databases where we were challenged to leverage some data
science tools to do something interesting as a final project. Being passionate
about insider trading I decided to collect all filings and run some analytics
to test some of the theories I had read about and some others that I had 
come up with over the year.

Now for some stats:

+  4.16 Million forms downloaded
+  20 days to download
+  13 K Companies
+  150 K Insiders

Tools used:

+  C# and WPF
+  [Libsvm](http://www.matthewajohnson.org/software/svm.html)
+  Microsoft SQL Server 2012

Interesting insights from this project:

+  How to resolve the tens of different ticker symbol representations
+  How not to normalize the data too much when destructured from XBRL
+  How to calculate what I call "Similar Market Climate"


Similar Market Climate

One theory I had early on was that if a person traded a stock that had a certain
price pattern as the same or even a different stock as a previous trade by 
the same or even a different trader the performance following that trade
might corelate. For example if a trader buys into strength and the chart has 
generally a certain pattern, her company might be experiencing similar business
as another company with the same pattern. 

The solution to finding similar climate, I think is pretty clever and I wanted
to share it with you.

You can apply different periods, this is just what I used. 

1) build a 12 (12 is arbitrary) dimensional vector of prices where each feature
is a price measurement say once per month

2) build a matrix of these vectors by sliding the starting month forward in
time

3) combine the resulting matricies of all companies of all time

4) find the closest market climate stock and time by ordering the matrix by
[cosine similarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity)

* In the end I didn't actually use the concept of "Similar Market Climate" as
part of the Insider AI algorithm, but it was a fun idea to develop and explore.

Hiden Treasure

In my humble opinion, ["Investment Intelligence from Insider Trading"](http://www.amazon.com/Investment-Intelligence-Insider-Trading-Seyhun/dp/0262692341) by Nejat Seyhun is the
best resource for practical implementation of insider trading as a trading
strategy. I highly recommend it :)

I'll briefly cover a few of the topics here and then dive deeper to each in
later posts.

Within the pages Seyhun lies out his research and data from insider trading.

+ Officer title matters. A lot.
  +  C level > Director > 10% owner
+ Price changes occur super soon after the trade
+ C level execs experience better than market average returns
+ combining insider with PE ratio and Price to book is interesting


- read one up on wall street

Peter Lynch specifies a few attributes of a perfect buy. He includes insider
trading as one of those primary indicators.



- tested a ton of strategies and some data science techniques from graduate and
  - wanted to build a ranking system to rank insiders and only follow the top ones
  - put screen shots of the versions available from the google drive doc.
  - market climate using cosine similarity between prices over a set period of frequencies

undergraduate data classes built versions 2 and 3 in these classes.
- tracked down George at UNR lecture
  - started work at MICS and loved it
  - learned a lot about how to analyze insider trades
  - learned a lot about the finance industry and how the big dogs do things
  - added some cool charting features and helped with the product in addition
to analyzing and publishing about trades.

- Every one is late to the party
- No one has a solid mobile app
- I want to get alerts and trade immediately
- took some time off and came back after refreshing my tool set and with lean 
eyes. What really matters is the alerts.
- rewrote in node js
- rewrote in ruby/rails 
- wrote a mobile client in swift
- rewrote in ionic framework
- help from ryan with the flask app and advisement about how to approach the
data problem again.
- consider talking about testing and how the donwloader has 500+ specs for parsing
- consider talking about how hard the barier to entry is
- talk about features i'd like to add
   -  proximity to IPO
   -  tenure
   -  proximity to non huge events (management changes. not earnings)
   -  5% on a daily basis (signaled stocks)
   -  20% overall since inception of stock
   -  +1 additional buying after
   -  Buy Up / Sell Down
   -  Trade Surfaced
   -  Reversal
   -  Cluster
   -  Unusually Large
   -  Change to Plan
- consider a piece where i review different academic articles
