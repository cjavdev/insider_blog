Hooked

In 2008 I bought my first stock. I remember watching TV while exercising at the 
gym. The coverage at the time was all about TARP and bailing out auto
manufactures. I remember watching a specific hearing where the CEO's of GM and
Ford were questioned. Both companies were asking for a ton of money and claiming
to be too big to fail. What I remember being the distinction between the two
was that Ford was not saying it would fail, but rather would be in really bad 
shape. Without the bailout they could make it, it just wouldn't be pretty. 
Having zero experience with the stock market this motivated me to start 
researching how to buy and sell stock. In the weeks just following this TV 
broadcast I opened my first brokerage account and made my first buy: FORD.

Needless to say I could've bought just about anything during that time period 
and would have done well. The entire market was thrashed and had no where to go
but up. Regardless, I was _hooked_. FORD made a great run and being an impulsive
short term investor I sold after holding for less than a year to pay for a trip. 

After this quick win I couldn't get enough. I even considered changing my major
from Computer Science to Finance because I loved trading so much. 

As a new trader I was spending a ton of time trying to find information about 
where to generate ideas. I would google: "How to find stocks to buy." As 
all investors know it's extremely hard to find good sources of ideas and 
generally good ideas. 

If it were easy everyone would do it, so no one would do it.

Twitter Sentiment

In an attempt to find a mechanism by which I could generate ideas I came across
this article. [Twitter Sentiment Article here]. YES! This was it. I'll just sit
back and let the cumulative unconcious ferret out stocks for me to buy. 

I began to work out the logisitcs: 
  + consume the twitter api
  + find tweets that reference company names or ticker symbols
  + use natural language processing to determine if the tweet is positive or 
negative
  + profit

Sounds like a great idea to some. To others it sounds a bit crazy. One of the 
people who thought it was crazy w
